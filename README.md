Project Overview
This project is a Predictive Analytics App that uses a Python Flask backend, an AWS-hosted SQL database, and a React frontend. The goal is to demonstrate regression and clustering analysis on a dataset: the backend will train a regression model (to predict a target variable) and a clustering model on sample data, then serve predictions and cluster assignments via a REST API. The React frontend will fetch these results and display them to the user. We use scikit-learn, an open-source Python ML library, which provides a wide range of regression and clustering algorithms. Flask is chosen as the web framework for the API because it is a lightweight “micro” framework for Python​
 and is widely used for building RESTful APIs. The data is stored in an AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) instance. In summary, the app flow is: User Input (Frontend) → Flask API → SQL Database & ML Models → JSON Response → User Display (Frontend).
Architecture and Components
Frontend (React): A simple single-page application created with Create React App. It has a form to input features for prediction and displays both the regression result and clustering groups fetched from the backend.
Backend (Flask): Provides API endpoints (/api/predict and /api/clusters). On startup or on request, it connects to the SQL database, loads data (via pandas), trains a linear regression model and a k-means clustering model using scikit-learn​, and returns results as JSON. Database (AWS RDS): A managed PostgreSQL (or MySQL) instance on AWS. It stores a sample dataset (e.g., house features and prices). The backend queries this database to obtain data for modeling. ML Models: Regression (e.g., LinearRegression) to predict a numeric target, and clustering (KMeans) to group the data. These use scikit-learn and pandas for data handling.
Data Flow: User inputs features → Frontend sends API request → Backend queries DB and uses ML models → Backend responds with prediction/cluster info → Frontend displays results.
