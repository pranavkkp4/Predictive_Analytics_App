This project is a Predictive Analytics App that uses a Python Flask backend, an AWS-hosted SQL database, and a React frontend. The goal is to demonstrate regression and clustering analysis on a dataset: the backend will train a regression model (to predict a target variable) and a clustering model on sample data, then serve predictions and cluster assignments via a REST API. The React frontend will fetch these results and display them to the user. We use scikit-learn, an open-source Python ML library, which provides a wide range of regression and clustering algorithms. Flask is chosen as the web framework for the API because it is a lightweight “micro” framework for Python​
 and is widely used for building RESTful APIs. The data is stored in an AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) instance. In summary, the app flow is: User Input (Frontend) → Flask API → SQL Database & ML Models → JSON Response → User Display (Frontend).
